\textbf{Study on the Combination of Bicycles and Micromobility with Public Transport}

\textsl{You are invited to participate in a research project on the use of public transport in conjunction with bicycles or micromobility options. The survey aims to better understand the mechanisms and challenges of this growing mobility phenomenon from the perspective of mobility and urban planning, with the goal of offering solutions to users.}%%Translated%%

\textsl{To participate in this survey, it is necessary to meet the following condition: having made a trip combining a light mobility mode (bicycle, scooter, \textsl{etc}.) with a public transport mode (train, metro, \textsl{etc}.). By light mobility modes, we refer to bicycles, electric scooters, or other mobility devices, whether personal or shared (bike or scooter in free-floating systems, \textsl{etc}.) and carried aboard public transport or parked or dropped off during the journey.}%%Translated%%

\textsl{This survey takes approximately twenty minutes.}%%Translated%%

\textsl{This study is part of a doctoral thesis at the Laboratoire Ville Mobilité Transport (Gustave Eiffel University and École des Ponts).}%%Translated%%
